abstract = "Extensive research on the production of culture has already shown that the artwork is not a product of mere individual genius, but rather the outcome of external social conditions. However, very few of them shed lights on how specific artistic features of the artwork, especially those with less linguistic expressions, can be the site for political suppression and struggle and how they are impacted over time. In this case study of the censorship of Chinese Hip-Hop music in 2018, I collected an original dataset of over 20,000 songs from a major music streaming service in China to see how Hip-Hop songs changed after the censorship in terms of their music and lyrics. With the help of audio processing algorithm, topic modeling, and machine learning, I found that the Hip-Hop songs became less Hip-Hopy after the censorship, whereas some other music genres started to incorporate more Hip-Hop elements. The censorship also became gradually less effective as Hip-Hop songs bounced back to be more Hip-Hopy over time. Therefore, I argue that the production strategies of Hip-Hop musicians were constantly in response to the dynamics of the political economic conditions."
